This guide covers common migration paths to AOF from other systems.

## From Ad-Hoc Agent Coordination

If your agents are currently coordinating via unstructured chat messages or custom scripts, AOF provides a structured foundation without requiring a complete rewrite.

### What Changes

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| Agent A tells Agent B "go do X" | Agent A calls `aof_dispatch` to create a task |
| Status tracked in chat | Status tracked in task files and board |
| No workflow enforcement | Workflow gates enforce quality stages |
| Manual retry on failure | Lease expiry + resurrection handles failures |
| No dependency tracking | `dependsOn` + cascading |

### Migration Steps

1. **Define your org chart** — document who your agents are and what they do
2. **Run `aof init`** — creates the directory structure
3. **Start dispatching via AOF** — replace `sessions_send` / `sessions_spawn` with `aof_dispatch`
4. **Add agents to use `aof_task_complete`** — instead of just sending a message back
5. **Gradually add workflow gates** — start with 2-gate review, expand as needed

### Minimal Integration

The absolute minimum integration requires agents to do just two things:

```json
// When starting work:
{ "tool": "aof_status", "params": { "status": "ready" } }
// → find my assigned tasks

// When done:
{ "tool": "aof_task_complete", "params": { "taskId": "...", "summary": "..." } }
```

Everything else (scheduling, lease management, notifications) is automatic.

## From Beads

AOF's task tracking shares conceptual overlap with Beads but adds dispatch, workflow gates, and multi-agent coordination.

### Key Differences

| Beads | AOF |
|-------|-----|
| Human-operated CLI tool | Agent-operated + human-observable |
| Linear task tracking | Full state machine with gates |
| No dispatch | Scheduler dispatches to agents |
| No leases | Lease-based locking |

### Coexistence

AOF and Beads can coexist — they use separate storage. During migration, you can run both in parallel:
- High-level project planning in Beads
- Implementation task tracking in AOF

---

## From GitHub Issues / Linear / Jira

These tools track work items for humans. AOF tracks tasks for agents. The mental model is different.

### What AOF Is Not

AOF is not a project management tool. It doesn't have:
- Rich UI with comments and attachments
- Team member assignment via drag-and-drop
- Sprints, epics, roadmaps
- Time tracking

### What to Migrate

Only migrate **actionable, implementation-level tasks** that agents will execute. Leave high-level planning, epics, and product roadmap in your existing PM tool.

**Good candidates for AOF:**
- "Implement endpoint X"
- "Fix bug in component Y"
- "Write tests for feature Z"
- "Deploy service to staging"

**Keep in Jira/Linear:**
- "Q2 roadmap"
- "User story: As a user I want..."
- "Epic: Authentication system"

### Task Format Mapping

```
Jira Issue → AOF Task
├── Summary → title
├── Description → body (## Instructions section)
├── Priority → priority (critical/high/normal/low)
├── Assignee → routing.agent
├── Labels → routing.tags
├── Story points → metadata.estimatedHours
└── Parent epic → parentId
```

---

## From Custom Orchestration Scripts

If you have Python/Node orchestration scripts that coordinate agents, AOF replaces the orchestration logic while keeping the agents themselves.

### Pattern: Replace Coordination Logic

**Before (custom script):**
```python
# Fragile, no crash safety, no visibility
result = agent_a.run(task_a)
if result.ok:
    agent_b.run(task_b)
    agent_c.run(task_c)
else:
    agent_a.run(task_a)  # retry manually
```

**After (AOF):**
```json
// Architect agent dispatches:
{ "aof_dispatch": { "title": "Task A", "agent": "agent-a" } }
{ "aof_dispatch": { "title": "Task B", "agent": "agent-b", "dependsOn": ["TASK-A-ID"] } }
{ "aof_dispatch": { "title": "Task C", "agent": "agent-c", "dependsOn": ["TASK-A-ID"] } }

// AOF handles: retry on failure, cascading deps, notifications, lease expiry
```

---

## Schema Migration

AOF tasks use `schemaVersion: 1`. If you have existing task files from an earlier format:

```bash
# Validate and auto-migrate existing task files
aof lint --fix

# Check for schema issues
aof lint
```

<Aside type="note">
AOF will add missing required fields with sensible defaults during migration. Review migrated tasks to ensure `routing` and `priority` are set correctly.
