import { Aside } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

AOF uses [`release-it`](https://github.com/release-it/release-it) with `@release-it/conventional-changelog` for automated releases. Releases are published to npm and GitHub Releases.

## Versioning

AOF follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/):

| Change type | Version bump | Example |
|-------------|-------------|---------|
| `feat!` or `BREAKING CHANGE` | major | 1.0.0 → 2.0.0 |
| `feat` | minor | 0.1.0 → 0.2.0 |
| `fix`, `perf` | patch | 0.1.0 → 0.1.1 |

## Release Workflow

<Aside type="note">
Only maintainers with `repo` scope GitHub PAT can create releases. If you're a contributor, open a PR and a maintainer will handle the release.
</Aside>

### Dry Run (Always Run First)

```bash
npm run release:dry
# Shows: what version would be bumped, what commits are included, what would be published
```

### Create a Release

```bash
# Patch release (bug fixes)
npm run release:patch

# Minor release (new features, backwards compatible)
npm run release:minor

# Major release (breaking changes)
npm run release:major

# Automatic bump based on conventional commits since last tag
npm run release
```

The release process:
1. Bumps `package.json` version
2. Creates a git tag (e.g., `v0.2.0`)
3. Generates release notes from conventional commits
4. Creates a GitHub Release with the notes
5. Pushes the tag
6. Publishes to npm

## Release Notes

Release notes are generated automatically from commits since the last tag. Only `feat`, `fix`, and `perf` commits are included. `chore`, `docs`, `style` are excluded.

Notes go to **GitHub Releases only** — no `CHANGELOG.md` is maintained in the repo.

## Pre-Release Checklist

Before cutting a release:

```bash
# 1. Run full test suite
npm test

# 2. Type check
npx tsc --noEmit

# 3. Build
npm run build

# 4. Verify what's included in the npm package
npm pack --dry-run

# 5. Check for accidental inclusions
# Package includes: dist/, prompts/, skills/, index.ts, openclaw.plugin.json, README.md

# 6. Dry run the release
npm run release:dry
```

## npm Package Contents

The published package includes only:

```
dist/           Compiled JavaScript + type definitions
prompts/        Agent prompt files
skills/         Shared skill definitions
index.ts        TypeScript entry (for ts-aware loaders)
openclaw.plugin.json  OpenClaw plugin manifest
README.md       Package documentation
```

Source files (`src/`), tests, and docs are excluded via `package.json` `files` field.
